## **📌 Overview**

Yeet-a-Mole is a fast-paced VR wave-survival action game built in Unity. Players use three tools—**Bat**, **Shovel**, and **Racket**—to neutralize mole types, convert them into mole-balls, and “Yeet” mole-balls at enemies. The core loop:

### **Whack → Bounce → Yeet**

Survive waves of Walkers, Spitters, and Tanks, and defeat a multi-phase **Final Boss** with teleport attacks, explosive mole rings, and minion summons.
